# Core Concepts

## Reactable Interface

```typescript
  const [state$, actions] = RxToggle();
```

Reactables (prefixed with Rx) separate state logic from UI presentation, improving testability and extensibility. They encapsulate state and expose an observable (state$) that UI components can subscribe to for changes.

State changes are predictable: the UI can only modify state by invoking action methods provided by the reactable.

## Reactable Primitive

A reactable primitive is the basic building block for modeling your state.

It can be used alone or combined with other primitives to create more complex reactables as your component or application grows.

**Hub and Store**

Internally, a reactable primitive consists of a hub and a store:

Hub: Dispatches actions.

Store: Updates state in response to actions.

<a class="rx-example" href="/reactables/ReactablePrimitiveOne.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  <img src="/reactables/ReactablePrimitiveOne.jpg" alt="Hub and Store" title="Hub and Store" style="max-width: 300px" />
</a>
<br>
<br>

See [Basic Toggle](https://reactables.github.io/reactables/guides/examples/#basic-toggle) for an example.

**Effects**

The hub also manages side effects, such as API requests.

When an action requires a side effect:

1. The action is replayed through an effect stream.

1. The side effect executes.

1. Responses are mapped into new actions and sent to the store.

  <img src="/reactables/ReactablePrimitiveTwo.jpg" alt="Effects" title="Effects" style="max-width: 300px" />
</a>

See [Fetching Data with an Effect](https://reactables.github.io/reactables/guides/examples/#fetching-data) for example.

**Sources**

Reactables can receive actions from multiple external sources and respond to them, enabling flexible integration with other parts of your application.

## Reactable Composition and Unidirectional Flow <a name="composition">

<a class="rx-example" href="/reactables/ReactableCombined.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">

- Reactables can be composed to handle larger state domains and **be reused**.  

- Reactables can **listen to other reactablesâ€™ state or actions**, forming a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**.  

- Ensures **predictable dependencies and state changes**.  

- **All actions flow in one direction**, supporting a reactive programming style.  

See [Composition with Reactables](https://reactables.github.io/reactables/guides/examples/#reactable-composition) for example.
