# Reactable Forms

Reactable Forms provide a reactable for managing the state of your form(s).  

Inspired by [Angular Reactive Forms](https://angular.dev/guide/forms), Reactable Forms take a different approach:  
state is managed with reducers inside reactables rather than class-based form controls.
